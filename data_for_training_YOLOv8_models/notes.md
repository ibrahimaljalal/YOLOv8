in this "data_for_training_YOLOv8_models" folder I have added only one folder for training.
this is because the repository will not have a large size.

the rest of the folders are in this google drive: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qBdf2eYhHaZd5sahBtCOGG1ghUZXppRF?usp=sharing


please note that the folder we are concerned with is named data (it contains the config.yaml file). the same thing with the folders in the google drive.
