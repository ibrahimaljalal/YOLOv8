in general if you want to open a google colab notebook file from a github repository, the notebook file (with .ipynb extension) should be inside a folder named blob.

the URL should look like this:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/<github account name>/<repository name>/<possibly additional directories>/blob/<your file name>.ipynb
